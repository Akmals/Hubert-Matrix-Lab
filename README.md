# Hubert-Matrix-Lab
This Program shows demonstrates how the multiplications and margin for error increases as a matrix size increases

Lab Prompt: Consider three systems of equations defined by: H x = b , n = size of H. We will take n = 11,12 and 13,
where b is a vector chosen in such a way that the exact solution of our system is xT = [1 1 1 1 .... 1].
